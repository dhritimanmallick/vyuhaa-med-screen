📌 Overview

The platform provides a digital pathology workflow for cervical cytology slides:

Slide Digitization → Uploads & manages scanned cytology slides.

AI-Assisted Diagnostics (CerviAI) → Assists pathologists with cytology interpretation.

Workflow Automation → Manages patient metadata, triaging, and reporting.

Scalable Infrastructure → Built for large cohort studies (50k+ patients).

Digitization: High-resolution whole-slide images from partner scanners.

Processing: Preprocessing pipeline built with Vite + React + TS.

AI Layer: CerviAI inference for triaging suspicious cases.

Pathologist Review: Remote/assisted reporting via secure dashboards.

Reporting: Exports structured diagnostic reports for integration with EMRs.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript

UI: shadcn-ui + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js (Express / APIs)

AI Integration: CerviAI inference APIs

Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL (configurable)

Deployment: Docker + Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP)
